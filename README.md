# Mat-Model
I used White Wine Quality dataset which is a tidy data set. This data set contains 4 898 white wines with 12 variables on quantifying the chemical properties of each wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent)
Objective: To identify which chemical properties influence the quality of white wines?
I used the method of multiple linear regression at first, then after obtaining my model, i was under the presumption that if i ufurther clean and analyse my data and use the most correlated features on a relative scale instead of all the features theat would make the model better but that was not it.
Most of the wines get a quality rating of five or six, while having good and bad wines seems more unlikely. Excellent wines >8 are absent.
